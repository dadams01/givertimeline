The Giver put his hand on Jonas's bare back and suddenly Jonas was on a sled, which he just now learned the name of. He glided down the hill and looked down at the runners. The snow was falling and he was having a lot of fun. Suddenly, he started to slow, and the fun stopped. He opened his eyes, and he was back in the Annex.

Horses and men were lying on the ground wishing to die. Cannon fire sounded in the distance. After what felt like hours it was finally over. Later the Giver gave him a very good memory with love in it: a Christmas celebration with family and warmth. The Giver continued to give him good and bad memories such as the time when he broke his leg sledding down the hill, but Jonas kept persevering."

His father weighed the naked babies and gave the heavier one to an assistant. Then he took the lighter baby, put a needle in the baby's forehead, and then put the dead baby down a trash chute.

He grabbed some food and started pedaling away on his dad's bike. Once safely out of the community, he rode along a path. In the morning Gabriel woke up, but Jonas gave him an exhausting memory so they could sleep. They repeated this: sleeping in the day and riding in the night. When planes flew over, he gave them cold memories so that the heat sensors on the plane would not detect them. After a couple of days, Jonas started running out of food. The snow fell, and Jonas only cared for Gabriel's life. He tried to give Gabriel warm memories, but his memories had mostly faded. Finally he climbed up on a snowy hill and found the sled, like in his memories. He and Gabriel sled down the hill toward warmth, light, and music."
